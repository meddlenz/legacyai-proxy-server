#Example Proxy Server for LegacyAI
This is an example implementation of a basic proxy server used to communicate with OpenAI's API. 
Once your server is set up and running you can add it's URL/endpoint to LegacyAI's _Proxy Server_ field. 

##Prerequisites
You will need:
- An OpenAI API key
- A Heroku account attached any of their dyno plans

##Setup steps
Follow the steps detailed on [Mac-Classic.com](http://mac-classic.com/articles/setting-up-a-legacyai-proxy-server/) to create a Heroku instance with the contents of this repository.
When your server is running you can add it to LegacyAI which will bypass the default server, and use yours instead.
